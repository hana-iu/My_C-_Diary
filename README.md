# My C++ Learning Diary

This repository contains my journey of learning C++ from scratch to Object-Oriented Programming and beyond.

### Structure
- `basics/` — Simple syntax & practice
- `oop/` — Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- `projects/` — Small applications I'll build along the way
